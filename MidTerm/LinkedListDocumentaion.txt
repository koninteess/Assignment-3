Using a linked list to create a shopping cart in e-commerce platforms is a smart way to efficiently handle user-selected items. The structure of a linked list is perfect for the ever-changing nature of shopping carts, where users are constantly adding, removing, and modifying their selections. Each item in the cart is like a node in the linked list, connected to the next item. This dynamic memory allocation allows the shopping cart to adjust easily to changes in the quantity and type of items without needing a set amount of space.

The benefits of using a linked list for a shopping cart are most noticeable when the cart's size is unpredictable or changes frequently. The quick insertion and deletion operations of linked lists make it easy to update the cart in real-time as users interact with the platform. Plus, moving through the linked list makes it simple to display and modify the cart's contents, improving the user experience.

Furthermore, the linked list structure fits perfectly with how shopping carts work. Users can easily add items to the end of the list, remove specific items by adjusting pointers, and navigate through the list for detailed item information. This flexibility and ease of modification create a responsive and user-friendly shopping experience, meeting the needs of modern e-commerce platforms that require flexibility and real-time updates. In summary, using a linked list for shopping cart implementation boosts the efficiency and user interaction of e-commerce systems, offering a dynamic and scalable solution for managing user-selected items.
